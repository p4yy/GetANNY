## Download GetANNY

<sub>Current release: **2.2.5** · Windows 10/11 · 64-bit</sub>

**[Open the official GetANNY 2.2.5 release page](https://github.com/WHITE8IRDD/GetANNY/releases/tag/v2.2.5)**

Choose one Windows package:

| Package | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| [Setup (.exe)](https://github.com/WHITE8IRDD/GetANNY/releases/download/v2.2.5/GetANNY-2.2.5-Setup.exe) | Recommended for most users |
| [Windows Installer (.msi)](https://github.com/WHITE8IRDD/GetANNY/releases/download/v2.2.5/GetANNY-2.2.5-Setup.msi) | Managed or scripted Windows installation |
| [Portable (.exe)](https://github.com/WHITE8IRDD/GetANNY/releases/download/v2.2.5/GetANNY-2.2.5-Portable.exe) | Running from a writable folder without a standard install |

Also available: [complete Windows bundle](https://github.com/WHITE8IRDD/GetANNY/releases/download/v2.2.5/GetANNY-2.2.5-Windows-Bundle.zip) · [SHA-256 checksums](https://github.com/WHITE8IRDD/GetANNY/releases/download/v2.2.5/SHA256SUMS.txt).

**Important:** Use only one installer format. The current release binaries are unsigned. Windows may show a SmartScreen warning; review the release notes and verify the downloaded file against the published SHA-256 checksums before running it.

## Features

- **File transfers:** HTTP and HTTPS downloads with progress, speed, pause, resume, retry and a searchable local history.
- **Media Studio:** inspect supported media pages, choose available formats, and download provided subtitles or thumbnails.
- **Torrents:** add magnet links, local `.torrent` files or supported `.torrent` URLs.
- **Browser handoff:** send supported downloads from Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Brave, Firefox, Vivaldi, Opera or Helium through the matching extension. Browser installation and permissions always require your approval.
- **A configurable workspace:** 12 themes, four interface languages (including Arabic RTL), download scheduling, speed limits and tray options.

Media and torrent availability depends on the source and network. GetANNY does not bypass DRM or site access restrictions. See [release notes](docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md) for version-specific changes and [release status](docs/RELEASE_STATUS.md) for verification details.

## Getting started

1. Download one of the Windows packages from the [official release page](https://github.com/WHITE8IRDD/GetANNY/releases/tag/v2.2.5).
2. Install GetANNY, or run the portable build from a writable folder.
3. Open GetANNY and choose your download folder and preferences.
4. To use browser integration, open the in-app browser setup guide and follow the instructions for your browser.
5. Add a direct file URL or use a supported browser action to send a download to GetANNY.

See the [Windows installation guide](docs/INSTALL_WINDOWS.md) and [browser setup and troubleshooting guide](docs/BROWSERS.md) for details.

## Privacy and security

Download history and preferences are stored locally. Browser integration uses a local authenticated bridge; extension installation and permissions require your approval. Downloaded files are not run automatically. For details, see [Architecture and security contracts](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) or report a vulnerability using [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
